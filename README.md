# Music Player with SoundCloud Streaming

This is a Python-based music player application built using **Tkinter** for the GUI and **Pygame** for audio playback. The app allows you to play local MP3 files, control playback (play, pause, stop, resume), adjust volume, and stream music from **SoundCloud** using **pywebview**.

## Features

- **Play Local Music:** Load and play MP3 files from your system.
- **Default Music Playback:** Plays a default `twinkle.mp3` file if no other file is selected.
- **Playback Controls:** Play, Pause, Stop, and Resume music easily with buttons.
- **Volume Control:** Adjust the volume using a horizontal slider.
- **SoundCloud Streaming:** Stream tracks directly from SoundCloud via an embedded browser window.
